Energy Logger
=============

This is a simple SmartApp that logs a few things to a custom DB that I run:

  * Current Wattage Usage
  * Current kWh
  * Current Indoor Tempurature (average of all sensors)
  * Current Exterior Tempurature (average of all sensors)

It's totally for me, but you can feel free to fork it and install it yourself.

It will also reset the meter's internal state on the last day of each month at 11:00pm.
